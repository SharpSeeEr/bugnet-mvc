# BugNET MVC
MVC based version of BugNET with a compatible schema to the current webforms version. This is just as an experiment to see how quickly it can come together through user contributions and improvements in the development process with the ASP.NET MVC web stack.

This project may start with the latest preview of ASP.NET 5 and MVC 6.
